# 🛠️ Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my engineering portfolio!  
I am a **Mechanical Design Engineer (MEng, Australia)** with 5+ years of experience in **CAD, FEA simulation, and product development** across heavy industries.  
My focus is on **design automation, advanced simulation, and digital engineering**.  

This repository showcases my **projects, scripts, and case studies** as I build expertise in **Python, CAD/FEA automation, and freelancing-ready workflows**.
